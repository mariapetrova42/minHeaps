MinHeap Code and Analysis

The main branch contains code and work created for 'CSC 317 01 Data Structures and Algorithms' at Lake Forest College, in May 2023, for Professor Sara Jamshidi. 
MinHeapInput.java and MinDriverInput.java are the files for the min heap data structure, and a driver, to create and test heaps with command-line input from the user. 
The corresponding MinHeapAnalysis.pdf file describes the min heap data structure, the algorithm for deleting the minimum in a heap, and compares their implementation to one with an array. 
The analysis of the code's complexity is in accordance to the class's specifications.
The code was written in Java with IntelliJ, and the analysis paper was formatted with LaTeX using Overleaf.

The read-from-file branch contains code and work created for 'CSC 255 Objects & Algorithms' at Oakton Community College, in April 2022, for Professor Kamilla Murashkina.
MinHeapFiles.java and MinDriverFiles.java contain the files for the creation of and testing of various heaps created from data found in in1.txt, in2.txt, in3.txt, and in4.txt.
The resulting heaps and testing of the deletion of the min value are output to out1.txt, out2.txt, out3.txt, and out4.txt, respectively.
The 2022 code was adapted and simplified for the needs of the 2023 project with the corresponding analysis.
